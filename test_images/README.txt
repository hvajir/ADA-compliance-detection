Test Images Directory
====================

Place your test images here. You'll need:

1. Store entrances (doors, ramps)
2. Parking lots (with or without accessible signage)
3. Store interiors (pathways, aisles)
4. Restroom areas
5. Signage examples

For the demo, find images from:
- YouTube videos (screenshot store walkthroughs)
- Google Street View
- Your own smartphone photos

Good sources:
- Search "retail store entrance" or "store walkthrough"
- Look for obvious accessibility issues (narrow doors, missing ramps, etc.)
